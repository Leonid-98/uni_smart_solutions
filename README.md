## Smart solutions, that  can be simply recreated at home.

### Used hardware for  communication folder:
 - Bluetooth: BT05/06 module 
 - Wi-Fi: ESP8266 based module 
 - UART:  Arduino â‡¿ Raspberry Pi (twisted pair)

### Sensors and misc:
 - Infrared: KY-022 (or similar ones)
 - RFID: MFRC-522 sensor 
 - LED: 1602 LCD / 1306 OLED 128x64 
 - Temperature: DS18B20 sensor
 - Misc: RGB strip WS2812B, IR LED, IR remote controller

P.S. There's no Arduino libraries list, i just don't remember all of them, **BUT** for infrared `IRremote` use version `2.2.3`
